##Each tile is represented by 1 unsigned int.
##UINT has 32 bits
##UINT FORMAT 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
##            u u u e w w w w
##u = unassigned e = enemy spawn w = wall
##wall direction in order WSEN
##The easy way to find the perfect number is using a binary to decimal calculator
##each tile is 50x50
##800x600 = 16x12 tiles
##Level File Format
